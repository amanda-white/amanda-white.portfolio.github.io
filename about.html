          <h1>A passion for technology</h1>
          <p>As a young kid, I would stack phone books on the computer desk chair so I could reach my families spare computer to <b>create designs</b> with Microsoft Paint. In middle school, I would build and decorate houses on The Sims, learning a lot about <b>color theory</b>. In college, I <b>studied abroad</b> in Buenos Aires, Argentina and became fascinated with European style architecture. I desperately wanted to capture the unique facades through <b>photography</b> and used basic photo edits to transform the images. My <b>passion</b> for photography grew and I began capturing the beauty of daily life and became comfortable editing photos for hours at a time.</p>

          <h1>A passion for understanding people</h1>
          <p>Throughout my college years, I spent much time in the restaurant industry waiting tables and <b>creating experiences</b> for guests. I had to identify who they were and what they wanted to enhance their dining experience according to their <b>unique needs</b>. Having numerous guests at the same time, I learned the importance of staying calm during stressful situations and how to multitask.
            <br /> Following graduation, I spent time in sales and customer service learning <b>empathy</b>, communication, and listening skills. In both positions, it was important to <b>discover user needs</b> and propose a solution that solved their problems.</p>

          <h1>Why I became a designer</h1>
          <p>Throughout my life, I have <b>depended</b> on web/mobile based technologies to perform daily tasks. I have struggled with poorly structured interfaces, module windows that <b>disrupt workflow</b>, module windows with no clear escape and icons with no labels. These examples are only some of the problems that I have experienced with <b>poorly designed</b> products. These struggles made me think… “hey, I can be a better designer; someone who designs with the <b>user needs first</b> and respects those needs to create a product that the user <b>enjoys using</b>”.
            <br />After that moment of clarity, I realized that user-centered design was the <b>right path</b> for me. My passion for technology and understanding people paired well with my <b>eye for design</b> and love for <b>creating beautiful things</b>. Additionally, while attending University I studied research methods for my Bachelors of Science degree in Communications and fell in love with analyzing data. These passions combined were all skills that a UX Designer needed to succeed, bringing me to embark on the path of becoming a <b>user-focused designer</b>.</p>

          <h1>My hobbies</h1>
          <p>Outside of design, I am passionate about maintaining a <b>healthful lifestyle</b> and I find much enjoyment in healthy cooking, practicing <b>yoga</b>, and running on the <b>beach</b>. I love trying new things and learned how to surf and snowboard in the past few years. The <b>resturaunt industry</b> led me to appreciate the <b>culinary arts</b> and you can often find me seeking out thoughtfully crafted dishes, <b>artisanal cheese</b> plates and wine.
            <br /><b>Creativity</b> plays an important role in my life and I craft <b>beautiful things</b> in my spare time.  Some of my favorite hobbies include capturing a <b>beautiful facade</b> or nature scene with my camera, learning how to sketch, melting wax with flowers to make a candle, creating driftwood art or jotting down a few lines of <b>poetry</b> as I am inspired throughout my daily life.</p>
