  <!--Scope & Constraints-->
  <section class="white">
      <div>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of this project included a full website redesign with the intent of <b>driving up ticket sales</b>,
          implementing a <b>new look</b>, and making the website <b>mobile responsive</b>.
          The team ensured that the website met state guidelines for <b>accessibility and functionality</b>, which included
          meeting <b>WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines</b>. We also will be implementing a
          <b>Spanish version</b> of the site in a future version which will be reflected in the design.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>The team I worked with had a bit over a <b>three month timeline</b> for this project to implement the <b>full UX process</b>
          and development of a <b>WordPress custom theme</b>; we launched at the end of January 2020.</p>

<!--Problem & Solution -->
  <section class="blue">

      <div>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p><b>The organization</b> felt that their website’s content was robust but was <b>lacking
          clear organization</b> and wanted their website to be redesigned so that their audiences
          could <b>easily find</b> what they needed -- <b>driving ticket sales</b> and memberships up in the process.
          Austin Opera also felt that their website was not on point with their current direction and needed a <b>revamped look and feel</b>.</p>

          <p>I found that the <b>navigation structure was confusing to users</b> and they were unsure where to find important
          information. The homepage was <b>missing an oppurtunity</b> to direct users where the organization wanted them to go. I also
          found that the website was content dense and <b>lacking the visual hierarchy cues</b> needed to
          guide users. Lastly, I found that users wanted more <b>meaningful and impactful imagery</b> to enrich their overall experience. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>I <b>worked with users</b> to design a website that addressed the pain points discovered during research.The <b>navigation system was restructured</b>
          to redefine existing information hierarchy and was tested with users to ensure usability. <b>Visual hierarchy cues</b> such as distinct sections, headers,
              and <b>bright call to actions</b> were added to enhance the website’s usability, providing a visual guide to help the user <b>discover
              useful information</b>. The website was redesigned to allow
              for <b>more images</b> to be implemented providing users with a visually compelling experience.</p>

    <section class="white">

      <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I started by doing a <b>competitive analysis</b> of other performing arts
          organizations both local to Austin and in other cities in Texas to see what other
          organizations were doing well in comparison. Then, we completed a <b>heuristic evaluation</b>
          of the current website to discover areas for improvement.</p>
        <p>After learning about the typical demographics through <b>interviews</b> with screened users, I <b>tested
        my assumptions</b> of the current website by leading the users through a <b>series of scenarios</b>. Based on the feedback from the users,
        their <b>opinions closely resembled mine</b>.</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <p><b>1.</b> Users desired a more <b>compelling experience</b>. Being that performing art patrons are fans
              because they liked to <b>escape reality</b>, they expected the website to have a <b>similar effect</b>.</p>
          </br >
          <p><b>2.</b> They were <b>frustrated with the navigation menu</b> and found that they had a hard time
              <b>finding specific information</b>.</p>
          </br >
          <p><b>3.</b> Users wanted an easier way to <b>access the calendar</b> as it was <b>hidden</b> inside of a mega
              menu and wasn’t easy to find.</p>
          </br >
          <p><b>4.</b> Users found that there was <b>too much text</b> and they did not want to read through it.</p>

                 She finds that a the <b>aesthetic quality</b> of a performing art’s website <b>influences her

                  <p>During the kick off meeting, I discovered <b>brand adjectives</b> the client thought best represented their brand.
                     The <b>budget allowed for two styles tiles to be designed</b>, and I used their brand adjectives to influenced
                     the two styles. The client had an <b>internal review to vote on their favorite</b>, and this was the style selected.</p>

                  <p>The <b>selected style influenced</b> the look and feel of the <b>high fidelity mockups</b>.</p>

            <p>I designed high fidelity versions of the landing page, single page, and single post type using <b>Figma</b>.

         <h3>Development & QA</h3>
         <p>The developer built the website on <b>WordPress with a custom theme</b> to give the client more
           control. After the development release, <b>I did several rounds of internal QA testing</b> to ensure
           functionality. After the site was fully developed, tested and deployed, Ci worked with the
           client to train them how to use the custom theme.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>I created a <b>user experience</b> allowing for the intended audiences to easily
            navigate Austin Opera’s website to <b>find what they need</b>. The designed solution included <b>vivid
            imagery, scannability, and visual appeal</b>. The design was tested to ensure that users were
            leaving <b>feeling delighted, rather than frustrated and confused</b>. The team helped me integrated multiple
            interactive visual and social media components.</p>

            <p>During custom theme development in Wordpress, my team ensured that the <b>management of events
            was easier for the admins</b> by creating a system so events automatically move to archive,
            eliminating the need for manual removal. The archived events were still <b>viewable and
            searchable by users</b>.</p>

            <p>Being that this website was recently launched, I <b>don't have solid success metrics to share</b>, but am looking forward to adding them
              one that data is available.</p>

    <!--Conclusion-->

            <section class="body-container">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Being that this was my <b>first client project</b>, I learned a lot about the <b>constraints of having a budget</b>. In the bootcamp I attended
              or when designing things with friends, <b>I had a lot of time to make things perfect</b>. I learned that <b>perfect does not always
              define done</b> - and that is okay.</p>
              <p>One of the <b>mistakes I made</b> was not updating earlier design artifacts when I iterated on the
              mockups. <b>Not updating the sitemap and user flow caused some confusion with the developers</b>. Luckily, being an inhouse team, we were able
              to <b>smooth things over quickly</b>. During this project, I also learned that <b>communication with the developer early on</b> makes for a smoother handoff.
              With that said, it was <b>fun to iterate my design on the fly</b> to redesign sections that were a bit too <b>complex for our budget constraints</b>. I was glad to learn
              these lessons to <b>improve my process</b>.</p>
