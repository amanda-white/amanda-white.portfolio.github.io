<!--Conclusion-->

        <section class="body-container">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The user pain points that the research uncovered <b>guided the application’s design</b>. The design needed to be easy to use yet a great collaboration tool. I initially <b>had doubts</b> about creating something that could address both of these features without developing an application with scope creep, yet I managed to dial back enough to do so.</p>
            <br />
          <p>Reflecting back on everything, the only thing I would have <b>done differently</b> is added more collaboration features. Having a small, chat modal pop up at the bottom of the screen instead of moving to conversations would be helpful and would have streamlined workflow. <b>Expanding on conversation capabilities</b> would have also been interesting. Being able to chat with team members in a designated area for specific projects would be useful to users. Though, I held back on designing that for this version but will definitely add that feature for the next.</p>
            <br />
          <p>Overall, this project <b>taught me</b> that you can not test enough nor can you receive enough feedback. Pothos turned out to be as beautifully designed as it was because I continued to search for feedback, would test with users, and have the design critiqued. I also <b>learned</b> that it is important to be both creative and flexible during the design process. Getting hung up on how something should look or function can hold you back and <b>iterating</b> is extremely important.</p>
