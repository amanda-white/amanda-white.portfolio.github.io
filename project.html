        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>In the realm of project management applications, there was much room for <b>growth</b>. Users face major frustrations with the most popular product management applications. They desperately need better <b>collaboration tools</b>, a <b>friendlier interface</b>, and <b>creative customization options</b>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Pothos aims to create a <b>simple</b> and user-friendly experience for users looking to <b>creatively manage projects</b>. Collaboration is made easy with <b>built-in chat</b>, content <b>comment sections</b>, and share links. Content is customizable, both in size and look and <b>visually appealing project cards</b> have personalizable images.</p>

      <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>A survey was created using <b>Google Forms</b> and was <b>shared</b> on multiple social media platforms, public forums, and on applicable survey websites. The goal was to <b>familiarize</b> with project management application <b>users</b> to <b>discover</b> needs and frustrations.</p>

          <p>It was found that users <b>depend</b> on project management applications to <b>collaborate</b> with team members yet this was the <b>main frustration</b>. Users complained about a complicated inferface that was difficult to use and wanted more room for <b>cuztomizability</b>.</p>

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The user pain points that the research uncovered <b>guided the application’s design</b>. The design needed to be easy to use yet a great collaboration tool. I initially <b>had doubts</b> about creating something that could address both of these features without developing an application with scope creep, yet I managed to dial back enough to do so.</p>
            <br />
          <p>Reflecting back on everything, the only thing I would have <b>done differently</b> is added more collaboration features. Having a small, chat modal pop up at the bottom of the screen instead of moving to conversations would be helpful and would have streamlined workflow. <b>Expanding on conversation capabilities</b> would have also been interesting. Being able to chat with team members in a designated area for specific projects would be useful to users. Though, I held back on designing that for this version but will definitely add that feature for the next.</p>
            <br />
          <p>Overall, this project <b>taught me</b> that you can not test enough nor can you receive enough feedback. Pothos turned out to be as beautifully designed as it was because I continued to search for feedback, would test with users, and have the design critiqued. I also <b>learned</b> that it is important to be both creative and flexible during the design process. Getting hung up on how something should look or function can hold you back and <b>iterating</b> is extremely important.</p>
